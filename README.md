# Project Title

This is my first webpage built using NEXT.JS/REACT.  It includes projects I have worked on while learning development including an api import from the next.js tutorial from www.tvmaze.com as well as my own Dungeons and Dragons attack simulation using old Special Edition 2 rules.  

## Getting Started

Currently, the project is set up so that you download all files necessary to run the project with no other configuration.  Just download or clone the project and launch it using "npm run dev" or "npm run start" or similar commands based on your own package manager.

### live demo

A Live demo of this project can be found here:  <https://out.mfioca1.now.sh/>  

Due to complications with the next.js framework, I have not yet configured the project for demo on github pages.
